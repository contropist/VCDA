### Total Addressable Market
One of the most important assessments that a VC needs is the Total Addressable Market (TAM) of the opportunity. 
Coming up with a high-quality TAM assessment is both an art and a science. But first, it is important to note 
that we are not referring to top-down TAM assessments found in most pitch decks. We have not found it effective
to use top-down TAM assessments in our decision-making.

A bottom-up TAM assessment differs from a top-down assessment fundamentally in that it is built using the specific 
business models in operation. The TAM reflects the opportunity arising from the chosen business models.

With that context, we are ready to dive into a sample TAM model embedded in a VC evaluation.

##### The Truthy Simulation
We will illustrate TAM building using a fictitious case study. Truthy is a company that evaluates the 
ethical fiber of candidates applying for jobs and offers an HRTech solution using machine learning. Please 
watch the first 16 minutes of the video below to understand how a bottom-up TAM is created in the context of Truthy.

The rest of the video explains how the remaining VC assessments are made in the context of Truthy's simulation.

##### The Truthy Model
You now have the context behind the [Truthy TAM Model](https://github.com/ulu-ventures/VCDA/blob/master/spreadsheets/Truthy.xlsm). 
This differs from the VentureDeal model (see [main docs](https://github.com/ulu-ventures/VCDA/tree/master/docs)) in that the outputs are shown on the Model page directly. The TAM
model can be seen under calculations.
